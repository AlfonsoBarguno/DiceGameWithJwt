## General info
Final bootcamp project demonstrating the use of Java and SpringBoot to build a microservice to be used by an online bank.
The system has 4 types of accounts, StudentChecking, Checking, Savings, and CreditCard. You can access either as an Admin or as a User, create an Account Holder or a Third Party user, and chose between four types of accounts. 
The system is able to modify accounts, make transfers, apply interest rates and penalty fees.
It is based in a SQL Database (you can change the name in in the application.properties file), has a Basic Auth level of security for Admins and Users and I'm currently working in the integration tests.
